## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Application won't start" or "ModuleNotFoundError"

  - Make sure Python 3.13+ is installed and all requirements are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
  - If you get import errors, try reinstalling dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
  - Ensure you have a GUI environment (desktop) - the application won't work in command-line only environments

**Problem**: "Stock prices show as 'N/A' or don't update"
- **Solution**: 
  - Check your internet connection
  - Verify the ticker symbol is correct (try looking it up on Yahoo Finance)
  - Some international stocks may not be available

**Problem**: "Can't see the application window"
- **Solution**: 
  - Make sure you have a desktop environment (GUI)
  - On Linux, install: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
  - Try resizing or moving the window (it might be off-screen)

**Problem**: "Database errors or data loss"
- **Solution**:
  - The database file `portfolio.db` stores all your data
  - Make regular backups of this file
  - Don't delete or modify this file manually

**Problem**: "AI analysis not working"
- **Solution**:
  - You need an OpenAI API key
  - Go to Configuration tab and enter your API key
  - This feature is optional and requires a paid OpenAI account

### Performance Tips

- **Close other programs** if the application runs slowly
- **Restart the application** if stock updates stop working
- **Keep the application updated** for the latest features
- **Backup your database file** regularly (portfolio.db)

### Data Safety

**Important**: Your investment data is stored locally in the `portfolio.db` file. This file contains all your trades, profits, and statistics. 

**Backup Recommendations**:
- Copy `portfolio.db` to a safe location regularly
- Consider cloud storage for automatic backups
- Keep copies before major updates or changes

## FAQ

**Q: Is my financial data secure?**
A: Yes! All your data is stored locally on your computer. Nothing is sent to external servers except for stock price updates from Yahoo Finance.

**Q: Do I need to pay for stock data?**
A: No, stock prices are provided free through Yahoo Finance. The AI analysis feature requires an OpenAI API key (which has costs).

**Q: Can I use this for international stocks?**
A: Yes, if the stocks are available on Yahoo Finance. Use the appropriate ticker symbol for the exchange.

**Q: What if I make a mistake entering a trade?**
A: Currently, you'll need to manually correct trades by adding offsetting entries. A future version may include edit/delete functionality.

**Q: Can I import data from my broker?**
A: Yes! The application can import from PDF account statements. Go to the Configuration tab and use the PDF import feature.

**Q: How accurate are the profit calculations?**
A: Very accurate, as long as you enter all costs (including fees and commissions) in the "Invest" amount when recording trades.

**Q: Can multiple people use the same installation?**
A: Each installation creates its own database. For multiple users, create separate folders with separate installations.

**Q: What happens if Yahoo Finance is down?**
A: Stock prices will show the last cached values (up to 5 minutes old) or "N/A" if no recent data is available. Your existing data is not affected.

**Q: Is there a mobile version?**
A: Currently, this is a desktop-only application. It requires a computer with Python and GUI support.
